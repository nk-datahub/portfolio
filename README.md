## About Me

I am a seasoned professional with expertise in **data analysis**, **software development**, and **Agile Scrum practices**.  

Currently, I’m focused on expanding my skills in the **data domain** — learning and applying **Python**, **machine learning (ML)**, and various **supervised/unsupervised models**.  

My goal is to analyze diverse datasets, build practical ML solutions, and continuously grow my capabilities as a data-driven problem solver.

## Projects

Here are some of my featured data projects:

- [**Uber Analysis – Linear Regression**](https://github.com/nk-datahub/Data-Analysis-and-ML/tree/main/P1)  
  Built a regression model to analyze Uber trip data and predict ride patterns.  
  Focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluating model performance.

- [**Fraud Detection – Logistic Regression**](https://github.com/nk-datahub/Data-Analysis-and-ML/tree/main/P2)  
  Applied logistic regression to identify fraudulent transactions.  
  Explored class imbalance handling and model evaluation with precision/recall metrics.

- [**BBC News Classification – Deep Learning**](https://github.com/nk-datahub/Data-Analysis-and-ML/tree/main/P3)  
  Implemented a text classification model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to categorize news articles into topics.  
  Techniques used: NLP preprocessing, word embeddings, and neural networks.

- [**Customer Segmentation – Clustering Analysis**](https://github.com/nk-datahub/Data-Analysis-and-ML/tree/main/P5)  
  Compared **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** clustering algorithms for customer segmentation.  
  Evaluated model performance using **silhouette score** and explained trade-offs between methods.
